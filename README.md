- Some of my personal projects are on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/brb3)

Currently working on a large rewrite of [SlackDotNet](https://github.com/brb3/SlackDotNet). A patched together version of this library powers the [devanewbot](https://github.com/devanooga/devanewbot), and my goal is to move all of the work I've performed there back into SlackDotNet proper.
